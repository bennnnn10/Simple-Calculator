# Simple App Calculator

Create a Simple App Calculator

		1. The application will ask the user to choose one of the 
      	   four math operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division)
		2. The application will ask the user for two numbers
		3. Display the result
		4. The application will ask if the user wants to try again or not.
		5. If yes, repeat Step 1.
		6. If no, Display ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù and the program will exit 
		7. Use Python Function and appropriate Exceptions to capture errors during   
    	   runtime.



## Program Sequence

- Prompting the user to select an operation
- Obtain user input for the operation
- Collect two numbers from the user
- Execute an operation based on user input
- Deal with an invalid operation number
- Print the result
- Request if the user wants to make another computation.
- If the user does not want to execute further calculation, the function should be closed.
- Handle runtime errors (Division by zero error and invalid input error)


## Guide

- You must use pip install in the terminal to install pyfiglet and terminal color in order to see the graphics of this program.

```bash
	pip install pyfiglet
	pip install termcolor
```

- After that, you need to run the program.

- When the software launches, you can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division calculations.

- It will also ask the user if they want to perform another calculation.

- If you type "y," the software will continue; if you type "n," it will close automatically.
